# CougarOS
An Operating System Simulating App Made in C# by an high school student. It's just a project so it's not a real thing. It's only possible to be run on Windows machines.

## Using it
There are 2 ways.
Everything is tested on MS Windows 10 1903 x64, .NET Framework 4.7.2. Whole solution takes up maximally 10 MB.

### 1) DIY Build
This is a solution of several projects. It can be opened in the Visual Studio. Visual Studio 2019 is highly recommended to use due to possible problems. Just open the "CougarOS.sln" file and the Visual Studio will do everything else. Then you just have to build it.

### 2) Download it separately
